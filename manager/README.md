The Outline Manager uses the [auto update feature](https://www.electron.build/auto-update) from electron-builder.

The update configuration is in the `.yml` files. Their location are specified in the `package_*_action.sh` scripts at https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-server/tree/master/src/server_manager/electron_app.

The `.json` file is for the old built-in update mechanism and is deprecated.
